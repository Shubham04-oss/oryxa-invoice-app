## ❓ FAQ

### **Q: Which is better, Railway or Render?**

**Railway** if you:
- Have a credit card

**Render** if you:
- Don't want to add credit card
- OK with 30-second wake-up time

### **Q: Can I use my existing Hostinger shared hosting?**

No, shared hosting doesn't support Node.js. But you can:

2. Keep MySQL database on Hostinger (already done!)
3. Host your landing page on Hostinger shared hosting
4. Link them together

### **Q: Will I lose my data?**

No! Your database is on Hostinger MySQL, not on Railway/Render. Your data is safe regardless of where the app runs.

### **Q: Can I migrate later?**

Yes! You can easily migrate:
- Railway → VPS
- Render → Railway
- Free → Paid plans
- Any platform → Any other

Just update environment variables and redeploy.

### **Q: What happens if I exceed free limits?**

**Railway:** You can add more credit ($5 = ~100 hours)
**Render:** Your app just sleeps more often (still works!)
**Both:** No surprise charges, you control spending
