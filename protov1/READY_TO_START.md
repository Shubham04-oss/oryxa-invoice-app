## 🚀 SETUP COMMANDS - RUN THESE NOW!

Copy and paste these commands one by one:

### Step 1: Install Dependencies (~2-3 minutes)
```bash
npm install
```
**What it does**: Installs all Node.js packages (Next.js, Prisma, PDF library, etc.)

---

### Step 2: Generate Prisma Client
```bash
npx prisma generate
```
**What it does**: Creates TypeScript types from your database schema

---

### Step 3: Apply Database Schema (~30 seconds)
```bash
npx prisma migrate dev --name init
```
**What it does**: Creates all tables in Supabase (Invoice, User, Automation, etc.)

**Expected output**:
```
Environment variables loaded from .env
Prisma schema loaded from prisma/schema.prisma
Datasource "db": PostgreSQL database "postgres"

PostgreSQL database postgres created at db.ycfxudvobatbwgakplie.supabase.co:5432

Applying migration `20231003000000_init`

The following migration(s) have been created and applied from new schema changes:

migrations/
  └─ 20231003000000_init/
    └─ migration.sql

Your database is now in sync with your schema.

✔ Generated Prisma Client
```

---

### Step 4: Seed Sample Data (~10 seconds)
```bash
node scripts/seed.js
```
**What it does**: Creates demo tenant, users, and sample invoices

**Expected output**:
```
🌱 Seeding database...
✅ Created tenant: Demo Company
✅ Created admin user: admin@demo.com
✅ Created 5 sample invoices
✅ Created 3 sample automations
🎉 Seeding complete!
```

---

### Step 5: Start Development Server
```bash
npm run dev
```
**What it does**: 
- Starts Next.js API on http://localhost:3000
- Starts background worker for jobs
- Enables hot reload for development

**Expected output**:
```
> oryxa@1.0.0 dev
> concurrently "next dev" "node worker/index.js"

[0] ready - started server on 0.0.0.0:3000, url: http://localhost:3000
[0] event - compiled client and server successfully
[1] 🚀 Worker started, polling queue...
[1] ⏰ Processing jobs every 5 seconds
```

## 🧪 TESTING YOUR SETUP

### Test 1: Health Check ✅
Open in browser or run:
```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/api/health
```
**Expected**: `{"status":"ok","timestamp":"2025-10-03T..."}`

---

### Test 2: Check Database Tables ✅
```bash
npx prisma studio
```
Opens database GUI at http://localhost:5555  
You should see: Tenant, User, Invoice, InvoiceItem, Payment, Automation tables

---

### Test 3: List Seeded Invoices ✅
```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/api/invoices \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```
**Expected**: Array of 5 sample invoices

---

### Test 4: Create New Invoice ✅
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/invoices \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "tenantId": 1,
    "clientName": "Test Client",
    "clientEmail": "client@example.com",
    "items": [
      {
        "description": "Web Development",
        "quantity": 10,
        "price": 100,
        "tax": 18
      }
    ],
    "dueDate": "2025-10-31"
  }'
```
**Expected**: Returns invoice JSON + queues PDF generation job

---

### Test 5: Check Worker Logs ✅
Look at terminal where `npm run dev` is running.  
You should see:
```
[1] ✓ Processing job: pdf_generation for invoice INV-2025-0001
[1] ✓ PDF generated and uploaded to B2
[1] ✓ Job completed successfully
```

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Use Prisma Studio** for visual database management:
   ```bash
   npx prisma studio
   ```

2. **Import API_EXAMPLES.http** into Postman/Insomnia for easy testing

3. **Check worker logs** to see job processing in real-time

4. **Monitor Supabase dashboard** for database metrics and logs

5. **Use SendGrid dashboard** to track email deliveries and opens

6. **Backblaze B2 dashboard** shows storage usage and file list

---

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### "Database connection failed"
```bash
# Test connection
npx prisma db pull

# If fails, check:
# 1. DATABASE_URL password is correct
# 2. Supabase project is not paused
# 3. Your IP is whitelisted (should be 0.0.0.0/0 by default)
```

### "npm install fails"
```bash
# Clear cache and retry
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm cache clean --force
npm install
```

### "Prisma migrate fails"
```bash
# Reset database (WARNING: deletes all data)
npx prisma migrate reset

# Or push without migration
npx prisma db push
```

### "Worker not processing jobs"
- Check terminal logs for errors
- Verify queue is enqueuing jobs (check database `JobHistory` table)
- Restart worker: Kill terminal → Run `npm run dev` again

### "PDF generation fails"
- Check B2 credentials are correct
- Verify bucket name is exactly: `Prototype-oryxa`
- Test B2 upload manually using AWS CLI

### "SendGrid email not sending"
- Verify sender email `ceo@oryxa.in` is verified in SendGrid
- Check API key is correct (starts with `SG.`)
- Look at SendGrid dashboard → Activity Feed for errors
