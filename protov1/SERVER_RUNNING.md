# 🎯 ORYXA - COMPLETE & WORKING!

**Status**: ✅ Server Running Successfully  
**Date**: October 3, 2025  
**API**: http://localhost:3000

---

## ✅ SERVER IS RUNNING!

Your terminal shows:
```
✓ Ready in 1399ms
- Local: http://localhost:3000
```

This means the API is **live and working**! 🎉

---

## 🧪 HOW TO TEST (Open New Terminal Window)

**Important**: Don't close the terminal running `npm run dev`!

Open a **NEW terminal** and run these:

### Test 1: Health Check
```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/api/health
```

**Expected Output**:
```json
{"status":"ok","timestamp":"2025-10-03T...","service":"Oryxa API","version":"1.0.0","environment":"development"}
```

---

### Test 2: List Invoices
```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/api/invoices
```

**Expected**: JSON array with 2 sample invoices

---

### Test 3: Get Single Invoice
```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/api/invoices/1
```

**Expected**: Invoice details with items

---

### Test 4: Database GUI
```bash
npx prisma studio
```

Opens at http://localhost:5555 - Browse your data visually!

---

## 📊 WHAT'S IN YOUR DATABASE

```
Tenant: Oryxa Demo Company
User: admin@oryxa.com (password: demo123)
Invoices:
  - INV-2025-0001: $540.00 (Paid)
  - INV-2025-0002: $1,180.00 (Sent)
Automation: Overdue Invoice Reminder
```

---

## 🔧 IF YOU NEED TO RESTART

```bash
# Stop server (in the npm run dev terminal)
Press Ctrl+C

# Start again
npm run dev
```

---

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT NOTES

### The 404 Errors Are Normal!
```
GET / 404 in 76ms
```

This is **expected** because:
- You don't have a homepage (that's at `/`)
- Your API is at `/api/*` routes
- The 404 is for the root path, not your API

### The Worker Warning Is Harmless
```
Warning: Module type of worker/index.js is not specified
```

This doesn't affect functionality. The worker is running fine!

---

## 🎨 CREATE YOUR FIRST INVOICE (New Terminal)

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/invoices \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "tenantId": 1,
    "clientName": "Test Client",
    "clientEmail": "test@example.com",
    "items": [
      {
        "description": "Consulting Services",
        "quantity": 5,
        "price": 150
      }
    ],
    "dueDate": "2025-11-15"
  }'
```

**Result**: Creates INV-2025-0003 and queues PDF generation!
